# Password-Generator

## Description

###I built this project to generate a password with various criteria that the client can ask of the generator, relating to upper cases, special characters, and so on.
###This will generate a password of length that the client chooses (between 8 and 128 characters) with their choice of upper chase, lower case and special characters as    well as numbers. 
###In working on this project, I learned a lot about functions, the ability and power of if statements, and for loops. 

## Credits

###John Young, my primary instructor. He provided the index.html base and the entire style.css required for this generator.
###Phillip Loy, my tutor. He helped me tremendously in remembering and implementing various functions that John had taught me in the week prior.
###Visual Studio Code as always for being an amazing, AMAZING program to code on.
